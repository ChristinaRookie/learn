# Bettercare learning programmes

These books are created with the [Electric Book](http://electricbook.works), a Jekyll template for making books, ebooks and book-like websites.

## Usage

The staging site includes [the docs](https://fireandlion.github.io/learn/docs/).

The live website is hosted at [bettercare.co.za/learn](http://bettercare.co.za/learn). To build the HTML for the live website, install all dependencies then run:

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --config="_config.yml,_configs/_config.live.yml"
```
