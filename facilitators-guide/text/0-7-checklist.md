## Before the first group meeting

* Identify needs for training at your institution. 
* Decide which need is the most urgent (you can get input from other staff members here). 
* Choose an appropriate Bettercare course. 
* Draw up a training budget. 
* Get stakeholder buy-in. 
* Advertise the course. 
* Hold a preliminary information session about the Bettercare course you will run. 
* Sign up group members (about 5–10) and get their contact details. 
* Organise how you will read the books (online for free or order print versions). 
* Contact everyone to say when and where the first official meeting will be held. 
* Start a ‘Facilitator’s File’ (a flip-file is an easy and neat option) where you keep copies of templates, notes and important documents. 

## At the first group meeting

* Let group members introduce themselves. 
* Introduce and discuss what decentralised learning means. 
* Make group rules that everyone agrees with. 
* Establish goals that everyone shares. 
* Explain how the learning programme works. 
* Explain your role in the group (not a teacher, but a facilitator). 
* Decide how, when and where future group meetings will happen. 
* Decide if you will write the exam at the end of the course (you can change your mind). 
* Choose a treasurer (who will monitor the budget and finances). 

## Before every group meeting

* All group members must read the relevant chapter. 
* Create the lesson plan (see [Chapter 4](04.html): How to run a Bettercare group). 
* Make sure you have all the resources you need for the meeting. 
* Organise someone to demonstrate the skill if needed. 
* Send out a reminder SMS to all group members of session venue and time. 

## At group meetings

* Discuss difficult sections of the chapter you have all studied the previous week. 
* Go through the chapter case studies. 
* Have a demonstration and discussion of the relevant skill. 
* Everyone does the post-quiz for the chapter you have studied and discussed. 
* Everyone marks and records the pre- and post-quizzes. 
* Everyone completes the pre-quiz for the next chapter. 

## After completing the chapters

* Decide who will write the exam (including yourself). 
* Email exams@bettercare.co.za to request as many exams as you need. 
* If you will be writing the exam, organise an exam invigilator. 
* Write the one-hour, 75-question exam. 
* Notify Bettercare of the participants’ results. 
* Receive certificates. 
* If 80% of your group are successful in the exam, you will receive a facilitator’s certificate. 
* Arrange a certificate handover ceremony if possible. 
* Take a group photo and send to exams@bettercare.co.za.
